\section{Coding}

In this section, please provide links to your code or directly pasted in the report. You can create subsections in LaTeX like this:
\subsection{Ultrasonic Sensor Code}
\subsection{Motor Code} 
Please write a paragraph summarizing the operation of the code. You should cite any references or resources that you used to make the code. You can conveniently cite sources like this: \cite{Manteghi2017} and \cite{Sheinker2013}. 
LaTeX is really nice for writing out equations too: 
\begin{equation}
V=\oint \overrightarrow{E}\cdot d\overrightarrow{l}  
\label{MyEquation}
\end{equation}
You can use this tool to help: https://webdemo.myscript.com/. Also this: https://mathpix.com/image-to-latex. 
You can also easily refer to equations like this: \ref{MyEquation}.
