\section{Testing and Experiments}
Here you can talk about your experimental results and include plots of any relevant data. The plots should be of professional quality. Use Python, MATLAB, or OriginLab. Excel in the engineering world is not professional. 

% Section for Miles, talk about a lot of failed experiments. This is where to talk about the acrylic failure, the first iteration of 3D printed parts, and the first iteration of the PCB.

\subsection{3D printed Testing}

We went through a few iterations for most of our 3D parts, and most of them had to do with increasing workability. We started with a flange that was too short, and made working with the PVC pipes difficult. During this 2nd iteration, we also added a cavity for the servo to sit in, protecting the servo from the elements. We also printed a few different versions of the bushing. The first version had a screw thread in, but the 2nd version tightened with a M2 bolt and nut, which allowed for a much easier assembly as the hole was now a through-hole instead of a threaded hole. The attachments from the motor and the servo to the PVC were also redesigned to add a through-hole screw, which was more structurally sound, and didn't rely on just friction.
