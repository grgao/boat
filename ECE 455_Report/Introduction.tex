\section{Introduction}

This project supports the University of Wisconsin Missing in Action Recovery and Identification Project (UW MIA RIP), which aims to locate and recover U.S. service members lost in global conflicts. Many aircraft have crashed in shallow coastal waters, making underwater wreckage detection both difficult and expensive. Our team was tasked with developing a low-cost autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) that could assist in this mission by generating a detectable magnetic field for submerged autonomous systems.

The ASV is constructed from common and cost-effective materials, including PVC pipe, closed-cell foam, HDF planks, and a polycarbonate platform. The system features a 100W solar panel powering two 12.8V LiFePO₄ batteries, which in turn support onboard electronics including a Raspberry Pi, SpeedyBee F405 flight controller, and magnetic field generation circuitry. A low-frequency sine wave is produced and amplified, creating an AC current that drives a large coil mounted to the boat—emitting a magnetic field for underwater detection.

Design considerations included autonomous GPS-based navigation using iNav firmware, waterproofing, modular construction, and safe power regulation. The project was completed under a \$500 budget constraint. This report documents the ASV’s design, hardware integration, control system, testing procedures, and potential future improvements.
